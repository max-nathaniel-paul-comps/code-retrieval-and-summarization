'Given linear recurrence operator `\operatorname{L}` of order DCNL `k` with polynomial coefficients and inhomogeneous equation DCNL `\operatorname{L} y = f`, where `f` is a polynomial, we seek for DCNL all polynomial solutions over field `K` of characteristic zero. DCNL The algorithm performs two basic steps: DCNL (1) Compute degree `N` of the general polynomial solution. DCNL (2) Find all polynomials of degree `N` or less DCNL of `\operatorname{L} y = f`. DCNL There are two methods for computing the polynomial solutions. DCNL If the degree bound is relatively small, i.e. it\'s smaller than DCNL or equal to the order of the recurrence, then naive method of DCNL undetermined coefficients is being used. This gives system DCNL of algebraic equations with `N+1` unknowns. DCNL In the other case, the algorithm performs transformation of the DCNL initial equation to an equivalent one, for which the system of DCNL algebraic equations has only `r` indeterminates. This method is DCNL quite sophisticated (in comparison with the naive one) and was DCNL invented together by Abramov, Bronstein and Petkovsek. DCNL It is possible to generalize the algorithm implemented here to DCNL the case of linear q-difference and differential equations. DCNL Lets say that we would like to compute `m`-th Bernoulli polynomial DCNL up to a constant. For this we can use `b(n+1) - b(n) = m n^{m-1}` DCNL recurrence, which has solution `b(n) = B_m + C`. For example: DCNL >>> from sympy import Symbol, rsolve_poly DCNL >>> n = Symbol(\'n\', integer=True) DCNL >>> rsolve_poly([-1, 1], 4*n**3, n) DCNL C0 + n**4 - 2*n**3 + n**2 DCNL References DCNL ..

'Calculates a Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and the p-value DCNL to test for non-correlation. DCNL The Spearman correlation is a nonparametric measure of the monotonicity DCNL of the relationship between two datasets. Unlike the Pearson correlation, DCNL the Spearman correlation does not assume that both datasets are normally DCNL distributed. Like other correlation coefficients, this one varies DCNL between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or DCNL +1 imply an exact monotonic relationship. Positive correlations imply that DCNL as x increases, so does y. Negative correlations imply that as x DCNL increases, y decreases. DCNL The p-value roughly indicates the probability of an uncorrelated system DCNL producing datasets that have a Spearman correlation at least as extreme DCNL as the one computed from these datasets. The p-values are not entirely DCNL reliable but are probably reasonable for datasets larger than 500 or so. DCNL Parameters DCNL a, b : 1D or 2D array_like, b is optional DCNL One or two 1-D or 2-D arrays containing multiple variables and DCNL observations. When these are 1-D, each represents a vector of DCNL observations of a single variable. For the behavior in the 2-D case, DCNL see under ``axis``, below. DCNL Both arrays need to have the same length in the ``axis`` dimension. DCNL axis : int or None, optional DCNL If axis=0 (default), then each column represents a variable, with DCNL observations in the rows. If axis=1, the relationship is transposed: DCNL each row represents a variable, while the columns contain observations. DCNL If axis=None, then both arrays will be raveled. DCNL nan_policy : {\'propagate\', \'raise\', \'omit\'}, optional DCNL Defines how to handle when input contains nan. \'propagate\' returns nan, DCNL \'raise\' throws an error, \'omit\' performs the calculations ignoring nan DCNL values. Default is \'propagate\'. DCNL Returns DCNL correlation : float or ndarray (2-D square) DCNL Spearman correlation matrix or correlation coefficient (if only 2 DCNL variables are given as parameters.

DCNL Returns DCNL bic : float DCNL Examples DCNL Consider the simple 1-D fitting example presented in the Astropy DCNL modeling webpage [3]_. There, two models (Box and Gaussian) were fitted to DCNL a source flux using the least squares statistic. However, the fittings DCNL themselves do not tell much about which model better represents this DCNL hypothetical source. Therefore, we are going to apply to BIC in order to DCNL decide in favor of a model.

'Chebyshev type II digital and analog filter design. DCNL Design an Nth-order digital or analog Chebyshev type II filter and DCNL return the filter coefficients. DCNL Parameters DCNL N : int DCNL The order of the filter. DCNL rs : float DCNL The minimum attenuation required in the stop band. DCNL Specified in decibels, as a positive number. DCNL Wn : array_like DCNL A scalar or length-2 sequence giving the critical frequencies. DCNL For Type II filters, this is the point in the transition band at which DCNL the gain first reaches -`rs`. DCNL For digital filters, `Wn` is normalized from 0 to 1, where 1 is the DCNL Nyquist frequency, pi radians/sample.  (`Wn` is thus in DCNL half-cycles / sample.) DCNL For analog filters, `Wn` is an angular frequency (e.g. rad/s). DCNL btype : {\'lowpass\', \'highpass\', \'bandpass\', \'bandstop\'}, optional DCNL The type of filter.  Default is \'lowpass\'.

'Cressie-Read power divergence statistic and goodness of fit test. DCNL This function tests the null hypothesis that the categorical data DCNL has the given frequencies, using the Cressie-Read power divergence DCNL statistic. DCNL Parameters DCNL f_obs : array_like DCNL Observed frequencies in each category. DCNL f_exp : array_like, optional DCNL Expected frequencies in each category.  By default the categories are DCNL assumed to be equally likely. DCNL ddof : int, optional DCNL "Delta degrees of freedom": adjustment to the degrees of freedom DCNL for the p-value.  The p-value is computed using a chi-squared DCNL distribution with ``k - 1 - ddof`` degrees of freedom, where `k` DCNL is the number of observed frequencies.  The default value of `ddof` DCNL is 0. DCNL axis : int or None, optional DCNL The axis of the broadcast result of `f_obs` and `f_exp` along which to DCNL apply the test.  If axis is None, all values in `f_obs` are treated DCNL as a single data set.  Default is 0. DCNL lambda_ : float or str, optional DCNL `lambda_` gives the power in the Cressie-Read power divergence DCNL statistic.  The default is 1.  For convenience, `lambda_` may be DCNL assigned one of the following strings, in which case the DCNL corresponding numerical value is used:: DCNL String              Value   Description DCNL "pearson"             1     Pearson\'s chi-squared statistic.

DCNL "cressie-read"        2/3   The power recommended in [5]_. DCNL Returns DCNL statistic : float or ndarray DCNL The Cressie-Read power divergence test statistic.  The value is DCNL a float if `axis` is None or if` `f_obs` and `f_exp` are 1-D. DCNL pvalue : float or ndarray DCNL The p-value of the test.  The value is a float if `ddof` and the DCNL return value `stat` are scalars. DCNL See Also DCNL chisquare DCNL Notes DCNL This test is invalid when the observed or expected frequencies in each DCNL category are too small.  A typical rule is that all of the observed DCNL and expected frequencies should be at least 5. DCNL When `lambda_` is less than zero, the formula for the statistic involves DCNL dividing by `f_obs`, so a warning or error may be generated if any value DCNL in `f_obs` is 0. DCNL Similarly, a warning or error may be generated if any value in `f_exp` is DCNL zero when `lambda_` >= 0. DCNL The default degrees of freedom, k-1, are for the case when no parameters DCNL of the distribution are estimated. If p parameters are estimated by DCNL efficient maximum likelihood then the correct degrees of freedom are DCNL k-1-p. If the parameters are estimated in a different way, then the DCNL dof can be between k-1-p and k-1. However, it is also possible that DCNL the asymptotic distribution is not a chisquare, in which case this DCNL test is not appropriate. DCNL This function handles masked arrays.  If an element of `f_obs` or `f_exp` DCNL is masked, then data at that position is ignored, and does not count DCNL towards the size of the data set.

DCNL - On Python 3, as per the PEP 3333 spec, ``path`` is first encoded to DCNL bytes using the Latin-1 encoding; the resulting set of bytes is DCNL subsequently decoded to text using the UTF-8 encoding; a DCNL :exc:`pyramid.exc.URLDecodeError` is raised if a the URL cannot be DCNL decoded. DCNL The ``path`` is split on slashes, creating a list of segments.  If a DCNL segment name is empty or if it is ``.``, it is ignored.  If a segment DCNL name is ``..``, the previous segment is deleted, and the ``..`` is DCNL ignored.

'This function escapes the command so that can be passed in the command line to JBoss CLI. DCNL Escaping commands passed to jboss is extremely confusing.

DCNL A sample value, let\'s say "a" (with single backslash), that is saved in the config.xml file: DCNL <bindings> DCNL <simple name="java:/app/binding1" value="a"/> DCNL </bindings> DCNL Eventhough it is just a single "" if you want to read it from command line you will get: DCNL /opt/jboss/jboss-eap-6.0.1/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=ip_addr:9999 --user=user --password=pass --command="/subsystem=naming/binding="java:/app/binding1":read-resource" DCNL "outcome" => "success", DCNL "result" => { DCNL "binding-type" => "simple", DCNL "value" => "a\b" DCNL So, now you have two backslashes in the output, even though in the configuration file you have one.

Run it and go to the configuration file to check. DCNL (You may need to reload jboss afterwards:  ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=ip_addr:9999 --user=user --password=pass --command=":reload" ) DCNL But if you want to run the same update operation directly from command line, prepare yourself for more escaping: DCNL ${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --controller=ip_addr:9999 --user=user --password=pass --command="/subsystem=naming/binding="java:/app/binding1":write-attribute(name=value, value="a\\\\b")" DCNL So, here you need 8 backslashes to force JBoss to save it as one. DCNL To sum up this behavior: DCNL (1) 1 backslash in configuration file DCNL (2) 2 backslashes when reading DCNL (3) 4 backslashes when writing from file DCNL (4) 8 backslashes when writing from command line DCNL ... are all the same thing:) DCNL Remember that the command that comes in is already (3) format.

'The main purpose of this function is to send fake Neighbor Solicitations DCNL messages to a victim, in order to either create a new entry in its neighbor DCNL cache or update an existing one. In section 7.2.3 of RFC 4861, it is stated DCNL that a node SHOULD create the entry or update an existing one (if it is not DCNL currently performing DAD for the target of the NS). The entry\'s reachability DCNL state is set to STALE. DCNL The two main parameters of the function are the source link-layer address DCNL (carried by the Source Link-Layer Address option in the NS) and the DCNL source address of the packet. DCNL Unlike some other NDP_Attack_* function, this one is not based on a DCNL stimulus/response model. When called, it sends the same NS packet in loop DCNL every second (the default) DCNL Following arguments can be used to change the format of the packets: DCNL src_lladdr: the MAC address used in the Source Link-Layer Address option DCNL included in the NS packet. This is the address that the peer should DCNL associate in its neighbor cache with the IPv6 source address of the DCNL packet. If None is provided, the mac address of the interface is DCNL used. DCNL src: the IPv6 address used as source of the packet. If None is provided, DCNL an address associated with the emitting interface will be used DCNL (based on the destination address of the packet). DCNL target: the target address of the NS packet. If no value is provided, DCNL a dummy address (2001:db8::1) is used. The value of the target DCNL has a direct impact on the destination address of the packet if it DCNL is not overridden. By default, the solicited-node multicast address DCNL associated with the target is used as destination address of the DCNL packet. Consider specifying a specific destination address if you DCNL intend to use a target address different than the one of the victim. DCNL dst: The destination address of the NS. By default, the solicited node DCNL multicast address associated with the target address (see previous DCNL parameter) is used if no specific value is provided. The victim DCNL is not expected to check the destination address of the packet, DCNL so using a multicast address like ff02::1 should work if you want DCNL the attack to target all hosts on the link. On the contrary, if DCNL you want to be more stealth, you should provide the target address DCNL for this parameter in order for the packet to be sent only to the DCNL victim. DCNL src_mac: the MAC address used as source of the packet. By default, this DCNL is the address of the interface. If you want to be more stealth, DCNL feel free to use something else. Note that this address is not the DCNL that the victim will use to populate its neighbor cache. DCNL dst_mac: The MAC address used as destination address of the packet. If DCNL the IPv6 destination address is multicast (all-nodes, solicited DCNL node, ...), it will be computed. If the destination address is DCNL unicast, a neighbor solicitation will be performed to get the DCNL associated address. If you want the attack to be stealth, you DCNL can provide the MAC address using this parameter. DCNL loop: By default, this parameter is True, indicating that NS packets DCNL will be sent in loop, separated by \'inter\' seconds (see below). DCNL When set to False, a single packet is sent. DCNL inter: When loop parameter is True (the default), this parameter provides DCNL the interval in seconds used for sending NS packets. DCNL iface: to force the sending interface.'

DCNL Default of 0 is equivalent to ``(0,)*input.ndim``. DCNL Returns DCNL result : ndarray DCNL The result of convolution of `input` with `weights`. DCNL See Also DCNL correlate : Correlate an image with a kernel. DCNL Notes DCNL Each value in result is :math:`C_i = \sum_j{I_{i+k-j} W_j}`, where DCNL W is the `weights` kernel, DCNL j is the n-D spatial index over :math:`W`, DCNL I is the `input` and k is the coordinate of the center of DCNL W, specified by `origin` in the input parameters. DCNL Examples DCNL Perhaps the simplest case to understand is ``mode=\'constant\', cval=0.0``, DCNL because in this case borders (i.e. where the `weights` kernel, centered DCNL on any one value, extends beyond an edge of `input`. DCNL >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 0, 0], DCNL ...               [5, 3, 0, 4], DCNL ...               [0, 0, 0, 7], DCNL ...

DCNL >>> ndimage.convolve(a, k, mode=\'constant\', cval=1.0) DCNL array([[13, 11,  8,  7], DCNL [11,  3, 11, 14], DCNL [16, 12, 14, 10], DCNL [15,  6, 10,  5]]) DCNL With ``mode=\'reflect\'`` (the default), outer values are reflected at the DCNL edge of `input` to fill in missing values. DCNL >>> b = np.array([[2, 0, 0], DCNL ...               [1, 0, 0], DCNL ...

DCNL >>> k = np.array([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]) DCNL >>> ndimage.convolve(b, k) DCNL array([[4, 2, 0], DCNL [3, 2, 0], DCNL [1, 1, 0]]) DCNL With ``mode=\'nearest\'``, the single nearest value in to an edge in DCNL `input` is repeated as many times as needed to match the overlapping DCNL `weights`. DCNL >>> c = np.array([[2, 0, 1], DCNL ...               [1, 0, 0], DCNL ...               [0, 0, 0]]) DCNL >>> k = np.array([[0, 1, 0], DCNL ...               [0, 1, 0], DCNL ...

'Performs hierarchical/agglomerative clustering. DCNL The input y may be either a 1d compressed distance matrix DCNL or a 2d array of observation vectors. DCNL If y is a 1d compressed distance matrix, DCNL then y must be a :math:`{n \choose 2}` sized DCNL vector where n is the number of original observations paired DCNL in the distance matrix. The behavior of this function is very DCNL similar to the MATLAB linkage function. DCNL A :math:`(n-1)` by 4 matrix ``Z`` is returned. At the DCNL :math:`i`-th iteration, clusters with indices ``Z[i, 0]`` and DCNL ``Z[i, 1]`` are combined to form cluster :math:`n + i`. A DCNL cluster with an index less than :math:`n` corresponds to one of DCNL the :math:`n` original observations. The distance between DCNL clusters ``Z[i, 0]`` and ``Z[i, 1]`` is given by ``Z[i, 2]``. The DCNL fourth value ``Z[i, 3]`` represents the number of original DCNL observations in the newly formed cluster. DCNL The following linkage methods are used to compute the distance DCNL :math:`d(s, t)` between two clusters :math:`s` and DCNL :math:`t`. The algorithm begins with a forest of clusters that DCNL have yet to be used in the hierarchy being formed. When two DCNL clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t` from this forest are combined DCNL into a single cluster :math:`u`, :math:`s` and :math:`t` are DCNL removed from the forest, and :math:`u` is added to the DCNL forest. When only one cluster remains in the forest, the algorithm DCNL stops, and this cluster becomes the root. DCNL A distance matrix is maintained at each iteration. The ``d[i,j]`` DCNL entry corresponds to the distance between cluster :math:`i` and DCNL :math:`j` in the original forest. DCNL At each iteration, the algorithm must update the distance matrix DCNL to reflect the distance of the newly formed cluster u with the DCNL remaining clusters in the forest. DCNL Suppose there are :math:`|u|` original observations DCNL :math:`u[0], \ldots, u[|u|-1]` in cluster :math:`u` and DCNL :math:`|v|` original objects :math:`v[0], \ldots, v[|v|-1]` in DCNL cluster :math:`v`. Recall :math:`s` and :math:`t` are DCNL combined to form cluster :math:`u`. Let :math:`v` be any DCNL remaining cluster in the forest that is not :math:`u`. DCNL The following are methods for calculating the distance between the DCNL newly formed cluster :math:`u` and each :math:`v`. DCNL * method=\'single\' assigns DCNL .. math:: DCNL d(u,v) = \min(dist(u[i],v[j])) DCNL for all points :math:`i` in cluster :math:`u` and DCNL :math:`j` in cluster :math:`v`. This is also known as the DCNL Nearest Point Algorithm. DCNL * method=\'complete\' assigns DCNL .. math:: DCNL d(u, v) = \max(dist(u[i],v[j])) DCNL for all points :math:`i` in cluster u and :math:`j` in DCNL cluster :math:`v`. This is also known by the Farthest Point DCNL Algorithm or Voor Hees Algorithm. DCNL * method=\'average\' assigns DCNL .. math:: DCNL d(u,v) = \sum_{ij} \frac{d(u[i], v[j])} DCNL {(|u|*|v|)} DCNL for all points :math:`i` and :math:`j` where :math:`|u|` DCNL and :math:`|v|` are the cardinalities of clusters :math:`u` DCNL and :math:`v`, respectively. This is also called the UPGMA DCNL algorithm. DCNL * method=\'weighted\' assigns DCNL .. math:: DCNL d(u,v) = (dist(s,v) + dist(t,v))/2 DCNL where cluster u was formed with cluster s and t and v DCNL is a remaining cluster in the forest. (also called WPGMA) DCNL * method=\'centroid\' assigns DCNL .. math:: DCNL dist(s,t) = ||c_s-c_t||_2 DCNL where :math:`c_s` and :math:`c_t` are the centroids of DCNL clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t`, respectively. When two DCNL clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t` are combined into a new DCNL cluster :math:`u`, the new centroid is computed over all the DCNL original objects in clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t`. The DCNL distance then becomes the Euclidean distance between the DCNL centroid of :math:`u` and the centroid of a remaining cluster DCNL :math:`v` in the forest. This is also known as the UPGMC DCNL algorithm. DCNL * method=\'median\' assigns :math:`d(s,t)` like the ``centroid`` DCNL method. When two clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t` are combined DCNL into a new cluster :math:`u`, the average of centroids s and t DCNL give the new centroid :math:`u`. This is also known as the DCNL WPGMC algorithm. DCNL * method=\'ward\' uses the Ward variance minimization algorithm. DCNL The new entry :math:`d(u,v)` is computed as follows, DCNL .. math:: DCNL d(u,v) = \sqrt{\frac{|v|+|s|} DCNL {T}d(v,s)^2 DCNL + \frac{|v|+|t|} DCNL {T}d(v,t)^2 DCNL - \frac{|v|} DCNL {T}d(s,t)^2} DCNL where :math:`u` is the newly joined cluster consisting of DCNL clusters :math:`s` and :math:`t`, :math:`v` is an unused DCNL cluster in the forest, :math:`T=|v|+|s|+|t|`, and DCNL :math:`|*|` is the cardinality of its argument. This is also DCNL known as the incremental algorithm. DCNL Warning: When the minimum distance pair in the forest is chosen, there DCNL may be two or more pairs with the same minimum distance. This DCNL implementation may chose a different minimum than the MATLAB DCNL version. DCNL Parameters DCNL y : ndarray DCNL A condensed distance matrix. A condensed distance matrix DCNL is a flat array containing the upper triangular of the distance matrix. DCNL This is the form that ``pdist`` returns. Alternatively, a collection of DCNL :math:`m` observation vectors in :math:`n` dimensions may be passed as an DCNL :math:`m` by :math:`n` array. All elements of the condensed distance matrix DCNL must be finite, i.e. no NaNs or infs. DCNL method : str, optional DCNL The linkage algorithm to use. See the ``Linkage Methods`` section below DCNL for full descriptions. DCNL metric : str or function, optional DCNL The distance metric to use in the case that y is a collection of DCNL observation vectors; ignored otherwise. See the ``pdist`` DCNL function for a list of valid distance metrics. A custom distance DCNL function can also be used. DCNL Returns DCNL Z : ndarray DCNL The hierarchical clustering encoded as a linkage matrix. DCNL Notes DCNL 1. For method \'single\' an optimized algorithm based on minimum spanning DCNL tree is implemented. It has time complexity :math:`O(n^2)`. DCNL For methods \'complete\', \'average\', \'weighted\' and \'ward\' an algorithm DCNL called nearest-neighbors chain is implemented. It also has time DCNL complexity :math:`O(n^2)`. DCNL For other methods a naive algorithm is implemented with :math:`O(n^3)` DCNL time complexity. DCNL All algorithms use :math:`O(n^2)` memory. DCNL Refer to [1]_ for details about the algorithms. DCNL 2. Methods \'centroid\', \'median\' and \'ward\' are correctly defined only if DCNL Euclidean pairwise metric is used. If `y` is passed as precomputed DCNL pairwise distances, then it is a user responsibility to assure that DCNL these distances are in fact Euclidean, otherwise the produced result DCNL will be incorrect.

'Return a generator of lists of edges, one list for each biconnected DCNL component of the input graph. DCNL Biconnected components are maximal subgraphs such that the removal of a DCNL node (and all edges incident on that node) will not disconnect the DCNL subgraph.  Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected DCNL component.  Those nodes are articulation points, or cut vertices. DCNL However, each edge belongs to one, and only one, biconnected component. DCNL Notice that by convention a dyad is considered a biconnected component. DCNL Parameters DCNL G : NetworkX Graph DCNL An undirected graph. DCNL Returns DCNL edges : generator of lists DCNL Generator of lists of edges, one list for each bicomponent.

A node `n` is an articulation point if, and only DCNL if, there exists a subtree rooted at `n` such that there is no DCNL back edge from any successor of `n` that links to a predecessor of DCNL `n` in the DFS tree.  By keeping track of all the edges traversed DCNL by the DFS we can obtain the biconnected components because all DCNL edges of a bicomponent will be traversed consecutively between DCNL articulation points.

Useful if the DCNL calling process has already redirected file descriptors to an DCNL output file. **Warning**: Only set this parameter to ``True`` if DCNL you\'re *sure* there are no open file descriptors to the calling DCNL terminal. Otherwise, you\'ll risk having the daemon re-acquire a DCNL control terminal, which can cause it to be killed if someone logs DCNL off that terminal. DCNL pidfile : str DCNL Path to file to which to write daemon\'s process ID. The string may DCNL contain a ``${pid}`` token, which is replaced with the process ID DCNL of the daemon. e.g.: ``/var/run/myserver-${pid}`` DCNL :raise DaemonError: Error during daemonizing'

The response contains DCNL at least one line for each directory entry with the prefix "file: " or DCNL "directory: ", and may be followed by file attributes such as DCNL "Last-Modified" and "size". DCNL For example, "smb://SERVER" returns a list of all shares on the given DCNL SMB/CIFS server; "nfs://servername/path" obtains a directory listing DCNL from the NFS server.

'Parse a single *query part*, which is a chunk of a complete query DCNL string representing a single criterion. DCNL A query part is a string consisting of: DCNL - A *pattern*: the value to look for. DCNL - Optionally, a *field name* preceding the pattern, separated by a DCNL colon. So in `foo:bar`, `foo` is the field name and `bar` is the DCNL pattern. DCNL - Optionally, a *query prefix* just before the pattern (and after the DCNL optional colon) indicating the type of query that should be used. For DCNL example, in `~foo`, `~` might be a prefix. (The set of prefixes to DCNL look for is given in the `prefixes` parameter.) DCNL - Optionally, a negation indicator, `-` or `^`, at the very beginning. DCNL Both prefixes and the separating `:` character may be escaped with a DCNL backslash to avoid their normal meaning. DCNL The function returns a tuple consisting of: DCNL - The field name: a string or None if it\'s not present. DCNL - The pattern, a string. DCNL - The query class to use, which inherits from the base DCNL :class:`Query` type. DCNL - A negation flag, a bool. DCNL The three optional parameters determine which query class is used (i.e., DCNL the third return value). They are: DCNL - `query_classes`, which maps field names to query classes. These DCNL are used when no explicit prefix is present. DCNL - `prefixes`, which maps prefix strings to query classes.

'Solves a 1st order differential equation with homogeneous coefficients DCNL using the substitution `u_1 = \frac{\text{<dependent DCNL variable>}}{\text{<independent variable>}}`. DCNL This is a differential equation DCNL .. math:: P(x, y) + Q(x, y) dy/dx = 0 DCNL such that `P` and `Q` are homogeneous and of the same order.  A function DCNL `F(x, y)` is homogeneous of order `n` if `F(x t, y t) = t^n F(x, y)`. DCNL Equivalently, `F(x, y)` can be rewritten as `G(y/x)` or `H(x/y)`.  See DCNL also the docstring of :py:meth:`~sympy.solvers.ode.homogeneous_order`. DCNL If the coefficients `P` and `Q` in the differential equation above are DCNL homogeneous functions of the same order, then it can be shown that the DCNL substitution `y = u_1 x` (i.e. `u_1 = y/x`) will turn the differential DCNL equation into an equation separable in the variables `x` and `u`.  If DCNL `h(u_1)` is the function that results from making the substitution `u_1 = DCNL f(x)/x` on `P(x, f(x))` and `g(u_2)` is the function that results from the DCNL substitution on `Q(x, f(x))` in the differential equation `P(x, f(x)) + DCNL Q(x, f(x)) f\'(x) = 0`, then the general solution is:: DCNL >>> from sympy import Function, dsolve, pprint DCNL >>> from sympy.abc import x DCNL >>> f, g, h = map(Function, [\'f\', \'g\', \'h\']) DCNL >>> genform = g(f(x)/x) + h(f(x)/x)*f(x).diff(x) DCNL >>> pprint(genform) DCNL /f(x)\    /f(x)\ d DCNL g|----| + h|----|*--(f(x)) DCNL \ x  /    \ x  / dx DCNL >>> pprint(dsolve(genform, f(x), DCNL ... hint=\'1st_homogeneous_coeff_subs_dep_div_indep_Integral\')) DCNL f(x) DCNL x DCNL |       -h(u1) DCNL log(x) = C1 +   |  ---------------- d(u1) DCNL |  u1*h(u1) + g(u1) DCNL Where `u_1 h(u_1) + g(u_1) \ne 0` and `x \ne 0`.

'Return a key that can be used for sorting. DCNL The key has the structure: DCNL (class_key, (len(args), args), exponent.sort_key(), coefficient) DCNL This key is supplied by the sort_key routine of Basic objects when DCNL ``item`` is a Basic object or an object (other than a string) that DCNL sympifies to a Basic object. Otherwise, this function produces the DCNL key. DCNL The ``order`` argument is passed along to the sort_key routine and is DCNL used to determine how the terms *within* an expression are ordered. DCNL (See examples below) ``order`` options are: \'lex\', \'grlex\', \'grevlex\', DCNL and reversed values of the same (e.g. \'rev-lex\'). The default order DCNL value is None (which translates to \'lex\'). DCNL Examples DCNL >>> from sympy import S, I, default_sort_key, sin, cos, sqrt DCNL >>> from sympy.core.function import UndefinedFunction DCNL >>> from sympy.abc import x DCNL The following are equivalent ways of getting the key for an object: DCNL >>> x.sort_key() == default_sort_key(x) DCNL True DCNL Here are some examples of the key that is produced: DCNL >>> default_sort_key(UndefinedFunction(\'f\')) DCNL ((0, 0, \'UndefinedFunction\'), (1, (\'f\',)), ((1, 0, \'Number\'), DCNL (0, ()), (), 1), 1) DCNL >>> default_sort_key(\'1\') DCNL ((0, 0, \'str\'), (1, (\'1\',)), ((1, 0, \'Number\'), (0, ()), (), 1), 1) DCNL >>> default_sort_key(S.One) DCNL ((1, 0, \'Number\'), (0, ()), (), 1) DCNL >>> default_sort_key(2) DCNL ((1, 0, \'Number\'), (0, ()), (), 2) DCNL While sort_key is a method only defined for SymPy objects, DCNL default_sort_key will accept anything as an argument so it is DCNL more robust as a sorting key. For the following, using key= DCNL lambda i: i.sort_key() would fail because 2 doesn\'t have a sort_key DCNL method; that\'s why default_sort_key is used. Note, that it also DCNL handles sympification of non-string items likes ints: DCNL >>> a = [2, I, -I] DCNL >>> sorted(a, key=default_sort_key) DCNL [2, -I, I] DCNL The returned key can be used anywhere that a key can be specified for DCNL a function, e.g. sort, min, max, etc...: DCNL >>> a.sort(key=default_sort_key); a[0] DCNL 2 DCNL >>> min(a, key=default_sort_key) DCNL 2 DCNL Note DCNL The key returned is useful for getting items into a canonical order DCNL that will be the same across platforms. It is not directly useful for DCNL sorting lists of expressions: DCNL >>> a, b = x, 1/x DCNL Since ``a`` has only 1 term, its value of sort_key is unaffected by DCNL ``order``: DCNL >>> a.sort_key() == a.sort_key(\'rev-lex\') DCNL True DCNL If ``a`` and ``b`` are combined then the key will differ because there DCNL are terms that can be ordered: DCNL >>> eq = a + b DCNL >>> eq.sort_key() == eq.sort_key(\'rev-lex\') DCNL False DCNL >>> eq.as_ordered_terms() DCNL [x, 1/x] DCNL >>> eq.as_ordered_terms(\'rev-lex\') DCNL [1/x, x] DCNL But since the keys for each of these terms are independent of ``order``\'s DCNL value, they don\'t sort differently when they appear separately in a list: DCNL >>> sorted(eq.args, key=default_sort_key) DCNL [1/x, x] DCNL >>> sorted(eq.args, key=lambda i: default_sort_key(i, order=\'rev-lex\')) DCNL [1/x, x] DCNL The order of terms obtained when using these keys is the order that would DCNL be obtained if those terms were *factors* in a product. DCNL Although it is useful for quickly putting expressions in canonical order, DCNL it does not sort expressions based on their complexity defined by the DCNL number of operations, power of variables and others: DCNL >>> sorted([sin(x)*cos(x), sin(x)], key=default_sort_key) DCNL [sin(x)*cos(x), sin(x)] DCNL >>> sorted([x, x**2, sqrt(x), x**3], key=default_sort_key) DCNL [sqrt(x), x, x**2, x**3] DCNL See Also DCNL ordered, sympy.core.expr.as_ordered_factors, sympy.core.expr.as_ordered_terms'

DCNL dtype : NumPy data type, optional DCNL A valid single NumPy data type used to initialize the array.

DCNL order : {\'C\', \'F\'}, optional DCNL Whether to store multidimensional data in C- or Fortran-contiguous DCNL (row- or column-wise) order in memory. If None, then the NumPy default DCNL is used. DCNL multigraph_weight : {sum, min, max}, optional DCNL An operator that determines how weights in multigraphs are handled. DCNL The default is to sum the weights of the multiple edges. DCNL weight : string or None optional (default = \'weight\') DCNL The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used for DCNL the edge weight. If an edge does not have that attribute, then the DCNL value 1 is used instead. DCNL nonedge : float (default = 0.0) DCNL The matrix values corresponding to nonedges are typically set to zero. DCNL However, this could be undesirable if there are matrix values DCNL corresponding to actual edges that also have the value zero. If so, DCNL one might prefer nonedges to have some other value, such as nan. DCNL Returns DCNL M : NumPy matrix DCNL Graph adjacency matrix DCNL See Also DCNL to_numpy_recarray, from_numpy_matrix DCNL Notes DCNL The matrix entries are assigned to the weight edge attribute. When DCNL an edge does not have a weight attribute, the value of the entry is set to DCNL the number 1.  For multiple (parallel) edges, the values of the entries DCNL are determined by the `multigraph_weight` parameter.  The default is to DCNL sum the weight attributes for each of the parallel edges. DCNL When `nodelist` does not contain every node in `G`, the matrix is built DCNL from the subgraph of `G` that is induced by the nodes in `nodelist`. DCNL The convention used for self-loop edges in graphs is to assign the DCNL diagonal matrix entry value to the weight attribute of the edge DCNL (or the number 1 if the edge has no weight attribute).  If the DCNL alternate convention of doubling the edge weight is desired the DCNL resulting Numpy matrix can be modified as follows: DCNL >>> import numpy as np DCNL >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 1)]) DCNL >>> A = nx.to_numpy_matrix(G) DCNL >>> A DCNL matrix([[ 1.]]) DCNL >>> A.A[np.diag_indices_from(A)] *= 2 DCNL >>> A DCNL matrix([[ 2.]]) DCNL Examples DCNL >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph() DCNL >>> G.add_edge(0,1,weight=2) DCNL 0 DCNL >>> G.add_edge(1,0) DCNL 0 DCNL >>> G.add_edge(2,2,weight=3) DCNL 0 DCNL >>> G.add_edge(2,2) DCNL 1 DCNL >>> nx.to_numpy_matrix(G, nodelist=[0,1,2]) DCNL matrix([[ 0.,  2.,  0.], DCNL [ 1.,  0.,  0.], DCNL [ 0.,  0.,  4.]])'

DCNL Parameters DCNL G : graph DCNL A bipartite network DCNL nodes : list or container DCNL Container with all nodes in one bipartite node set. DCNL normalized : bool, optional DCNL If True (default) normalize by connected component size.

DCNL See Also DCNL betweenness_centrality, DCNL degree_centrality DCNL sets, DCNL is_bipartite DCNL Notes DCNL The nodes input parameter must conatin all nodes in one bipartite node set, DCNL but the dictionary returned contains all nodes from both node sets. DCNL Closeness centrality is normalized by the minimum distance possible. DCNL In the bipartite case the minimum distance for a node in one bipartite DCNL node set is 1 from all nodes in the other node set and 2 from all DCNL other nodes in its own set [1]_. Thus the closeness centrality DCNL for node `v`  in the two bipartite sets `U` with DCNL `n` nodes and `V` with `m` nodes is DCNL .. math:: DCNL c_{v} = \frac{m + 2(n - 1)}{d}, \mbox{for} v \in U, DCNL c_{v} = \frac{n + 2(m - 1)}{d}, \mbox{for} v \in V, DCNL where `d` is the sum of the distances from `v` to all DCNL other nodes. DCNL Higher values of closeness  indicate higher centrality. DCNL As in the unipartite case, setting normalized=True causes the DCNL values to normalized further to n-1 / size(G)-1 where n is the DCNL number of nodes in the connected part of graph containing the DCNL node.
